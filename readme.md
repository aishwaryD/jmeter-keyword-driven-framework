JMeter Keyword Driven Framework 

Keyword driven framework designs/implementations may vary from project to project. But the basics always remains the same â€“ identify &define keywords and associate them to actions or procedures.

This is ready to use keyword driven framework for jMeter. Clone it and customize it as per your requirements and needs. The whole architecture is divided into following 7 tasks:-

1- Identify a set of reusable keywords. 

2- Associate an action related to these keywords.

3- Assign a library to these keywords.

4- Design test suites in .csv files using existing keywords

5- Design the execution engine or the control unit to command the existing .csv files & libraries.

6- Doing parameterization to eliminate hard coded values.

7- Maven integration & command line execution

Please Note: For this framework, we have used scripts based on Recording Controllers and designed keywords for them. But similar things you can do with your api endpoints as well to design similar keyword driven framework.
